# AQGEO 2024: A tour on potential fields modelling

## Santiago Soler

### UBC-GIF

November 7, 2024

---

## Layout

1. Recap on gravity and magnetic fields.
1. Analytic solutions for rectangular prisms.
1. Implementation for a single source and single receiver.
1. SimPEG: implementation for regular meshes.
1. Inversion.

---

## Motivation

<!--
Maybe add a motivation slide, showing that we usually measure data above the
earth surface, we remove the normal earth and the igrf field, so we can get the
signal of bodies with anomalous densities or magnetized bodies.
-->

---

## Recap on gravity and magnetic fields

<!--
Image of arbitrary body, with density and magnetization.
General equations for gravity and magnetic fields generated by it.
-->

---

## Analytic solutions for rectangular prisms

<!--
We usually discretize the subsurface using regular meshes. In SimPEG we use
regular meshes with rectangular cells.
We assign a constant physical property to each one of the meshes.
We need a way to compute the fields that the mesh generates on observation
points in the survey.
-->

---

## Analytic solutions for rectangular prisms

<!--
Show a prism with its boundaries.
Show integral equations.
Switch to shifted coordinates (coordinate system located on the observation
point).
-->

---

## Analytic solutions: gravity fields

<!--
Analytic solution to the gravity potential and acceleration components.
-->

---

### Gravity fields: simple implementation

<!--
Show a dumb implementation of the gravity fields.
-->

---

## Analytic solutions: magnetic fields

<!--
Analytic solution to the magnetic field components.
-->

---

## Examples

$$ E = mc^2 $$
